# acdocudat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of acdocudat is to help the user create a data dictionary/codebook for a user selected R dataset along with some summary statistics to help to get an initial sense of data completeness, possible outliers, and more. The package will provide functions that can be used to form different sections of the codebook, put a codebook table together, and be output to a PDF. The package will work with all different types of datasets in order to be useful within a data management setting.

## Installation

You can install the released version of acdocudat from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("acdocudat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(acdocudat)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
